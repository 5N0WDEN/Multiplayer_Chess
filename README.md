# ♟️ Chess Game



## 📌 Overview
This is a **custom-built Chess game** developed entirely **independently** — without any external assistance or AI-generated code.

The project uses **Python sockets** and **multithreading** to create an **adhoc networked chess system**, supporting:
- **Offline (Player vs Player)**
- **Online (Player vs Player over LAN/Internet)**
- **Computer (Player vs AI / Computer vs Computer)** modes.

It’s a full-fledged chess engine and GUI built from scratch, handling real-time move synchronization, chat, and matchmaking through sockets.
